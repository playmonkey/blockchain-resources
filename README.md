Blockchain Resources

A list of resources learning blockchain/ethereum/bitcoin and coding smart contracts in solidity. I will keep this updated to reflect current/potential regulatory standards on crypto as a whole. WIP...

Blockchain
==========



Bitcoin
=======

  1. Bitcoin forum (a good place to get help) - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php
  2. Bitcoin wiki portal (bookmark) - https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page
  3. A good intro for beginners - https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/target
  4. Understanding the bitcoin block header - https://medium.com/fcats-blockchain-incubator/understanding-the-bitcoin-blockchain-header-a2b0db06b515
  5. Merkle Tree and Bitcoin mining (A good intro)- http://www.righto.com/2014/02/bitcoin-mining-hard-way-algorithms.html


Ethereum
========
  1. Ethereum Foundation (blogs with technical info) - https://ethereum.foundation/
  2. Ethereum (tutorials/docs, defacto site) - https://ethereum.org/
  

Solidity Smart Contracts
========================

  IDE's
  =====
   1. Remix (great intro to smart contracts & testing) https://remix.ethereum.org
   2. WebStorm
   3. Visual Code
    
  Unit Testing Frameworks (Functional)
  ==================
   1. Truffle
   2. Hardhat
   3. Foundry
   4. OpenZepplin
    
  Security Based Testing
  ======================
    Static Testing Tools
    
    Static testing is the process of testing smart contracts via code inspection, looking for weaknesses in code potentially leading to exploits.
       1. rand tool
    
    Dynamic Testing Tools
    
    Dynamic testing is the process of testing smart contracts on (ideally) test networks by fuzzing contracts, passing out of bounds arguments etc. 
       1. rand tool 1
      
    
  Other Great Resouces
  ====================
   1.  Jean Cvllr (smart contract enginner) - https://github.com/CJ42
    
  Well known Vulns
  ================
   1. Reentracy
   2. Buffer overflow/underflow
    
  Securing Contracts
  ==================
   1. Bug bounties
   2. Formal verification of contracts - https://runtimeverification.com/blog/how-formal-verification-of-smart-contracts-works/
